\chapter{Sensitivity Analysis with StochSS}

StochSS implements forward sensitivity analysis for the deterministic (ODE-based) solver based on SUNDIAL's CVODES solver \cite{sundials}.

For instance, if we consider the population of $P$ and the parameter $Vmax$ in the Michaelis-Menten model in the \textbf{Public Library}. The sensitivity of the rate of the increase in population $P$ to the parameter $Vmax$ is defined as the incremental rate of change in $P$ due to incremental changes in $Vmax$:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial P(t)}{\partial V_{max}}.
\end{equation}

These are the sensitivities that StochSS produces. There is no rescaling to make these sensitivities unitless.

\section{Example: Michaelis-Menten}

In this example we will study the Michaelis-Menten model from the StochSS Public Library. Details on the model can be found in \cite{wiki-michaelis-menten}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Import the model from the public library. By default, it will be called \textit{michaelis\_menten}.
\item Navigate to the \textbf{Simulation Manager}, select the model, and click \textbf{Next}.
\item Under \textbf{Simulation type}, select \textit{Deterministic + Sensitivity}.
\item You can now select the parameters for which you wish to compute sensitivities. Select $Km$, $k3$, $mu$, and $Vmax$, as these are the only parameters that directly affect the values of the species $S$ and $P$.
\item Click \textbf{Run Locally}. 
\item Navigate to the \textbf{Job Summary} page to analyze the output. You can plot concentrations as well as sensitivities.
\end{itemize}
